# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# place = Place.new(name: "Rock of Ages Granite Quarry", address: "555 Quarry Dr., Barre, VT")
# place.save
# place = Place.new(name: "World's Talles Ladderback Chair", address: "123 Chair Ln, Bennington, VT")
# place.save
# place = Place.new(name: "Monument to a Lake Monster", address: "999 Lake Front Dr., Burlington, VT")
# place.save
# place = Place.new(name: "Queen Connie Statue", address: "555 Route 7, Leicester, VT")
